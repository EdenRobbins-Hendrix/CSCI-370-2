Game Name: Witch's Brew \
\
Intent: Mix a tower defense game with visual novel-esque portions \
\
Narrative Structure: Protect villagers from oncoming zombies with your enchanted coffee beans \
\
Mechanics: Click on zombie path to place coffee beans, lose health when zombies reach the cafe, get money from zombies, buy more coffee beans, interact with villagers \
\
Aesthetics: Meant to feel kinda cozy, pixel art style for graphics \
\
Joys: It was fun making custom assets, programming pathing for zombies, and incorporating pixelart using TileMaps. \
\
Struggles: Getting the buying coffee mechanic functioning is very frustrating! Also, making it so that objects remained the same after scene changes.  \

What Eden Did: \
I designed the overall game concept. Additionally, I sourced the Kenney packs that we used in the final game and made edits to some sprites to fit what we wanted from the project. Furthermore, I made custom music for the game as well as wrote the script. I also made the dialogue system work, as well as implement all mechanics present in the cafe sections (except for the scene transition.) \
