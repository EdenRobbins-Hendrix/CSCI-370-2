Game Name: Witch's Brew \
\
Intent: Mix a tower defense game with visual novel-esque portions \
\
Narrative Structure: Protect villagers from oncoming zombies with your enchanted coffee beans \
\
Mechanics: Click on zombie path to place coffee beans, lose health when zombies reach the cafe, get money from zombies, buy more coffee beans, interact with villagers \
\
Aesthetics: Meant to feel kinda cozy, pixel art style for graphics \
\
Joys: It was fun making custom assets, programming pathing for zombies, and incorporating pixelart using TileMaps. \
\
Struggles: Getting the buying coffee mechanic functioning is very frustrating! Also, making it so that objects remained the same after scene changes.  \
